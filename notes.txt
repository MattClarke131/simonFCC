Plan:
1. create setPhase FUNCTIONS
  1.1 make all buttons have inactive/active status
  1.2 create onclick functions for all buttons that check data-activity


todo:
fix positioning of gameMenu contents


Questions:
1. When I call setInitPhase, I get a type error, but the function works as expected.
2. Which functions should have an underscore, and which should not?
