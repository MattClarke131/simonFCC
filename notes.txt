Plan:
1. create setPhase FUNCTIONS
  1.1 make all buttons have inactive/active status
  1.2 create onclick functions for all buttons that check data-activity


todo:
fix positioning of gameMenu contents


Questions:
1. When I call setInitPhase, I get a type error, but the function works as expected.
2. Which functions should have an underscore, and which should not?

Shawn:
 the code to switch phases is very linear, recipe-oriented. you could use a data
 structure to represent the phases instead of functions. (code and data are two parts
 of the same coin. this is a deep principle that you'll need to get familiar with).
 having it as data means you can update it, store it in a database, vend it from a
 server, etc etc
How do this?
